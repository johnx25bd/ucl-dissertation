# Introduction

## Frame ethical context.

Emergent informational entities hold promise for unprecedented levels of coordination.

Questions:

Can data be owned? By whom? (Creator - subject tension.)
Do machines have a right to privacy?


## Define key terms.

Distinguish between physical and conceptual reality, and defend the need to treat them different for the purposes of this research.

Data (binary, analogue). Information. Agent / entity + types (human (conscious animate), machine (not conscious animate)). Data transfer systems. Data processing systems. Empirical sensors (precision and accuracy concerns). Aggregated data. Scope. Incentives. Location- vs content-addressing. Privacy / security. Blockchain, distributed ledger. Informational infrastructure.
