"These ain't conflict diamonds -
is they Jacob? Don't lie to me mayne"

"Even though it's thousands of miles away,
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today.
Over here that's the drug trade, we die from drugs.
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs,
the diamonds, the chains the bracelets the charmses,
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless,
til I see a picture of a shorty armless
and here's the conflict"


Abstract



# Introduction

## Frame ethical context.

Emergent informational entities hold promise for unprecedented levels of coordination.

Questions:

Can data be owned? By whom? (Creator - subject tension.)
Do machines have a right to privacy?


## Define key terms.



Distinguish between physical and conceptual reality, and defend the need to treat them different for the purposes of this research.

Data (binary, analogue). Information. Agent / entity + types (human (conscious animate), machine (not conscious animate)). Data transfer systems. Data processing systems. Empirical sensors (precision and accuracy concerns). Aggregated data. Scope. Incentives. Location- vs content-addressing. Privacy / security. Blockchain, distributed ledger. Informational infrastructure.
