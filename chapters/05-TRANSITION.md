Discuss ethical considerations of implementing - and of *not* implementing - such a system.

Emphasize importance of this system complementing existing ones, not replacing them. <--!!!

Economic factors
- Incentivizing private firms to participate.
  - Special consideration to large firms with data lakes substantial enough to be of value without participating in this market.

Political factors
- Agreeing on standards for digitizing systems (legacy and otherwise).
- Challenges implicit in enabling policy-makers to design adaptable policy considerate of technical realities and the pace of innovation.
- Labor unions and other resistant interests.

Legal factors
- Compliance with existing local, national, regional and international law and regulatory regimes.
- Ricardian contracts.
- Ricardian treaties?

Social factors
- Educating the public on data, privacy, etc.
- What motivates behavior change? Do is behavior change in end consumers necessary for such a system to work? Maybe not ...
