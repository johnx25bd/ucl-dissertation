"These ain't conflict diamonds -
is they Jacob? Don't lie to me mayne"

"Even though it's thousands of miles away,
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today.
Over here that's the drug trade, we die from drugs.
Over there they die from what we buy from drugs,
the diamonds, the chains the bracelets the charmses,
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless,
til I see a picture of a shorty armless
and here's the conflict"


Abstract



# Introduction

## Frame ethical context.

Emergent informational entities hold promise for unprecedented levels of coordination.

Questions:

Can data be owned? By whom? (Creator - subject tension.)
Do machines have a right to privacy?


## Define key terms.



Distinguish between physical and conceptual reality, and defend the need to treat them different for the purposes of this research.

Data (binary, analogue).

Information.

Agent / entity + types (human (conscious animate), machine (not conscious animate)).

Data transfer systems.
- TCP / IP / HTTP
- Client-server
- Peer to peer

Information processing systems.

Empirical sensors (precision and accuracy concerns).

Aggregated data.

Scope.

Incentives.

Location- vs content-addressing.

Privacy / security.

Blockchain, distributed ledger.

Protocol.

Asymmetric cryptosystems. Homomorphic cryptography.

Informational infrastructure.

Data trust.

Antifragile.

Coordination problem. Examples of pre-competitive coordination benefiting competing interests (Physical example: shipping container standards. Informational example? TCP / IP.).

## Concise problem statement

Network dynamics / scalability / resiliency / antifragility depend massively on network governance.

Combination of privacy, scalability, accessibility.

Problems:

1. Fragmentation of IoT information resource management systems results in much of the value of data collected not being captured, for device owners and for society.

2. Complexity of devices and code means maintaining system security and situational awareness of computing resources is difficult. Security vulnerabilities carry deeper consequences as we come to rely more and more on connected sensor networks for our infrastructure and the systems supporting 21st century life.

3. The system is vulnerable to abuse if security protocols are not adhered to, including end-to-end encryption from point of capture (device), difficult in resource-constrained edge.

4. Principal-agent problem with regards to trusted third parties developing and maintaining informational infrastructures for IoT networks. Unsure of incentives / motivations of these companies. The Thing Network.

5. Relying on private companies to host and maintain data and software means systems depend on a single point of failure; problematic for critical systems, and systems required to function for a long time into the future. Back compatibility. Trusting the existence of the company (solvency). Rent seeking - emergent informational governance systems (DAOs) offer the potential to remove the need for centralized, resource-intensive entities to maintain the code and data storage systems required in traditional service provision.

6. Accuracy of sensor data is affected by a range of factors, including hardware, software, bugs, malicious actors (attackers), distribution of sensors. Accuracy is of paramount importance as we base policy and business processes on sensor data.



Explore - speculate - on the implications of these technologies. Specifically look at trusted hardware x proxy re-encryption x digital signatures.

Investigate dynamics of centralized and decentralized connected sensor networks. Measures of network efficiency and resiliency and informational accuracy and interoperability. Agent-based models.



## Research questions

How does the level of centralization of connected sensor networks affect measures of network efficiency and resiliency? What are the effects of these dynamics on aggregate informational accuracy? 

Centralization:
- Primarily, path of data flows and corresponding computing / bandwidth resource usage. Cloud to cloud. Cloud to Gateway. Cloud to Sensor. Gateway to Gateway. Sensor to Sensor.

Simulated events
-  Common mode failure.
- Network failures.
  - Geographic
  - Organizational
- Sensor death (i.e. battery depletion)




## Hypotheses

Positive correlation: level of centralization and network efficiency.
Negative correlation: level of centralization and network resiliency.
