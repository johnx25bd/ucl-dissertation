**Are you planning to collaborate with an external partner? If yes, give details of who.**

Formally, no.

We will seek input from a range of people occupying key roles in private, public and research / NGO sector organizations working at tactical, operational and strategic levels to seek to understand the systems currently in place for monitoring compliance with logistics / transport generally.

Our focus will be on understanding the factors under consideration by key decision makers, and the user experience of anyone interacting with monitoring and compliance systems.

**Proposed Research Topic (150-300 words – what you wish to study, why you think it is an important or useful subject)**[](#proposed-research-topic)

We would like to study and understand the technical, economic and political  aspects of a system of situationally aware secure objects able to detect, process, record and transmit information, governed by smart contracts.

We would like to explore the applications of such a network of interconnected, self-sovereign objects (controlled by software or human agents) to international trade, especially of controlled and sensitive goods..

We intend to investigate the technical feasibility of endowing these secure connected sensors with private keys inaccessible to other informational entities (i.e. humans or computers), thereby providing them a functional cryptographic identity. The implications of this form of machine-controlled externally-owned account may be quite significant as, within the appropriate public key infrastructure, it could assure the integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiability of data transmitted by such a sensor. This system would allow such sensors to sign transactions calling smart contract functions, enabling direct participation of machine / software agents in the governance processes of decentralized autonomous organizations, where they might serve as a type of empirical oracle. Further, secure connected sensors could improve efficiency and reliability of business processes, especially in the regulatory technology and insurance industries.

Distributed ledgers, blockchains and smart contracts are useful in contexts where non-trusting parties want to interact in the informational space - transacting value or accessing and modifying informational assets - without oversight from some authority. In contexts in which such an authority exists - intra-firm, say, or within the jurisdiction of a sovereign nation - drawbacks including complexity and resource intensity may make blockchains a poor option for storing and updating data. For this reason, we will focus our research on contexts where interacting entities would benefit from some clear, transparent and objective infrastructure and protocol to conduct their affairs. Specifically, between small groups of firms competing - but also coordinating - in a market (i.e. shipping, shipping insurance and trade finance), and between *sovereign nations*.

The dissertation will examine two questions:

What considerations apply to the technical feasibility of a connected network of situationally-aware objects (i.e. shipping containers)?

- Energy supply and usage
- Cost
- Adoption and usability
- Connectivity
- Trusted hardware
- Public key infrastructure
- Interoperability
- Privacy
- Ethics

How would the governance of such a network affect its operation at scale?

Here we intend to build and tune agent-based models representing one of a number of governance systems that could be applied to the network. "Governance system" refers to the rules by which devices are manufactured, deployed and managed (including, crucially, on-device software), as well as governance of data captured by the sensors.

- Centralized. Separate, private data architectures. Siloed nodes.
- Consortium. Private blockchains, proprietary protocol, trusted nodes.
- Fractal federal. Public or private blockchain, open protocol, mix of trusted and incentivized nodes.
- Decentralized. Public blockchains, open protocol, incentivized nodes.

We intend to design the physical and informational systems with an eye towards integration with the existing legal system. Ricardian contracts are human-readable contracts that delegate some authority to smart contracts. We hope to incorporate research into the existing legal mechanisms for enforcing arms control treaties and propose a configuration that might serve as the basis for Ricardian contract design. We will examine technical, political and economic factors in the design of Ricardian treaties, in which sovereign states utilize distributed ledgers and smart contracts to govern informational assets related to arms control (such as compliance reporting).

**Overarching aims of the Dissertation (150-300 words – what you hope to achieve)**

This dissertation seeks to investigate the relationship between matter and meaning, and how they interact. We suspect that, much as cooling water reaches a point at which its molecules become ordered and aligned, a similar phenomenon might occur as we near saturation of information transfer between sentient (i.e. able to perceive and respond to information) entities in the physical/informational space. If understanding improves, entities are less likely to act in a way that would disrupt another's intentions; given that agents can adapt their intentions and actions in response to their environment, deconfliction of behavior may be possible.

Our goal is to understand many of the technical aspects of how such a system would be built, including hardware, code, etc, and governed, including by smart contracts. We then intend to model such a network at scale using an agent-based approach, in order to identify what behavior might emerge as the system grows.   

In order to ensure relevance to contemporary issues, we will focus our efforts on an issue space that holds human, political and economic relevance: weaponry. In this respect, our ultimate overarching aim would be to contribute to the development of a way to ensure that each weapon is tracked and traced and only used by authorized individuals in authorized contexts, thereby reducing the availability of weapons for use by non-state and illicit actors. We hope to contribute to efforts to improve control over these objects within the current paradigm, and offer ideas on how a better system may be designed and deployed.

By creating scarcity of a fundamental input to violent conflict - weapons - we hope that violent actors will be forced to be more selective as to the targets of those weapons: fewer deaths, and especially fewer civilian deaths. Our impetus to pursue this research agenda is our conclusion of the untenable nature of our behavior towards one another; our sense of urgency is born from a perception that the longer we leave these habits unbroken, the greater the scale of harm.

**Methodology**

Our work output will consist of a few components.

We will be to imagine a system in which this physical-informational system is implemented, including development and testing of a functional prototype. Specifications of a working prototype with an accompanying design fiction to speculate on how such a system might be implemented will serve as a foundation for further work.

Next, we will develop agent-based models of networks of such devices, as informed by the development of the functional prototype. Each of the identified governance structures will be modeled, using parameter sweeps in an effort to understand the system dynamics of each. This agent-based approach is intended to inform researchers and innovators working on designing the foundations of the system described, which is ongoing.

Finally, we hope to lay out a series of recommended actions policy makers could take to move towards implementation of this connected system. Here our focus will shift to political, economic and human considerations. Our hope is for these to serve as areas of further research.

**Sources of data**

We see two broad categories of data analysis required within this dissertation.

First, we expect our efforts to create a functional prototype of such a system to generate substantial amounts of data, which will be analyzed to assess its efficacy. The connected sensors will be recording data about their environment, which could be used as inputs to machine learning algorithms or passed into smart contract function calls. Further, the human custodians of these networked cases will generate some data in the form of cryptographically signed transactions to administrate the system.

Second, ultimately agent-based models are created to produce data similar to data recorded from the real world, to serve as a basis for analysis. Our models will generate such data, which we will analyze to assess modeled behavior of the systems at scale.


**Action plan for May / June**

Continue meeting with researchers, policy makers and business people, aiming to gain a general understanding of issue spaces including trade / logistics (including financing and insurance), trade of sensitive goods, diplomacy / treaties, and smart / Ricardian contracts. I hope to speak with people working at:

- Willis Towers Watson
- Parsyl
- Provenance
- Mattereum
- Antares / Lloyd's
- Trade financing banks (HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, etc)
- Port operators / customs officials
- United Nations (Container Control Programme, Office on Drugs and Crime, International Maritime Organization, Office for Disarmament Affairs, 1540 Committee, etc)
- UK Parliament

Begin to design physical and informational architectures required to develop a functional prototype; perhaps begin purchasing equipment and studying libraries.

Design agent-based models.
