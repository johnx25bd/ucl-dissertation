**Provisional dissertation title**

Secure connected sensors and Ricardian contracts: exploring opportunities for innovation in arms control regimes

**Potential supervisor**

Dr Duncan Wilson

**Are you planning to collaborate with an external partner? If yes, give details of who.**

Formally, no.

We will seek input from a range of people occupying key roles in private, public and research / NGO sector organizations working at tactical, operational and strategic levels to seek to understand the systems currently in place for monitoring compliance with logistics / transport generally, and arms control regimes specifically.

Our focus will be on understanding the factors under consideration by key decision makers, and the user experience of anyone interacting with monitoring and compliance systems.

**Proposed Research Topic (150-300 words – what you wish to study, why you think it is an important or useful subject)**

We would like to study and understand the technical, economic and political  aspects of a decentralized system of situationally aware secure objects able to detect, process, record and transmit information, governed by Ricardian contracts.

We would like to explore the applications of such a network of interconnected, self-sovereign objects (controlled by software or human agents) to international trade, especially of controlled goods: arms and dual-use goods, and pharmaceuticals.

We intend to investigate the technical feasibility of endowing these secure connected sensors with private keys inaccessible to other informational entities (i.e. humans or computers), thereby providing them a functional cryptographic identity. The implications of this form of machine-controlled externally-owned account may be quite significant as, within the appropriate public key infrastructure, it could assure the integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiability of data transmitted by such a sensor. This system would allow such sensors to sign transactions calling smart contract functions, enabling direct participation of machine / software agents in the governance processes of decentralized autonomous organizations, where they might serve as a type of empirical oracle. Further, secure connected sensors could improve efficiency and reliability of business processes, especially in the regulatory technology and insurance industries.

Distributed ledgers, blockchains and smart contracts are useful in contexts where non-trusting parties want to interact in the informational space - transacting value or accessing and modifying informational assets - without oversight from some authority. In contexts in which such an authority exists - intra-firm, say, or within the jurisdiction of a sovereign nation - drawbacks including complexity and resource intensity may make blockchains a poor option for storing and updating data. For this reason, we will focus our research on contexts where interacting entities would benefit from some clear, transparent and objective infrastructure and protocol to conduct their affairs. Specifically, between small groups of firms competing - but also coordinating - in a market (i.e. shipping, shipping insurance and trade finance), and between *sovereign nations*.

We intend to design the physical and informational systems with an eye towards integration with the existing legal system. Ricardian contracts are human-readable contracts that delegate some authority to smart contracts. We hope to incorporate research into the existing legal mechanisms for enforcing arms control treaties and propose a configuration that might serve as the basis for Ricardian contract design. We will examine technical, political and economic factors in the design of Ricardian treaties, in which sovereign states utilize distributed ledgers and smart contracts to govern informational assets related to arms control (such as compliance reporting).

**Overarching aims of the Dissertation (150-300 words – what you hope to achieve)**

This dissertation seeks to investigate the relationship between matter and meaning, and how they interact. We suspect that, much as cooling water reaches a point at which its molecules become ordered and aligned, a similar phenomenon might occur as we near saturation of information transfer between sentient (i.e. able to perceive and respond to information) entities in the physical/informational space. If understanding improves, entities are less likely to act in a way that would disrupt another's intentions; given that agents can adapt their intentions and actions in response to their environment, deconfliction of behavior may be possible.

In order to ensure relevance to contemporary issues, we will focus our efforts on an issue space that holds human, political and economic relevance: weaponry. In this respect, our ultimate overarching aim would be to contribute to the development of a way to ensure that each weapon is tracked and traced and only used by authorized individuals in authorized contexts, thereby reducing the availability of weapons for use by non-state and illicit actors. We hope to contribute to efforts to improve control over these objects within the current paradigm, and offer ideas on how a better system may be designed and deployed.

By creating scarcity of a fundamental input to violent conflict - weapons - we hope that violent actors will be forced to be more selective as to the targets of those weapons: fewer deaths, and especially fewer civilian deaths. Our impetus to pursue this research agenda is our conclusion of the untenable nature of our behavior towards one another; our sense of urgency is born from a perception that the longer we leave these habits unbroken, the greater the scale of harm.

**Methodology**

Our work output will consist of a few components.

Our literature review will survey the history and current state of networked computing and wireless communications, as well as concepts of cryptography and trusted hardware fundamental to understanding blockchains and smart contracts. We may also provide an overview of arms control regimes, focused on technical and legal mechanisms for verifying compliance.

The core effort will be to imagine a system in which this physical-informational system is implemented, including development and testing of a functional prototype. Specifications of a working prototype with an accompanying design fiction to speculate on how such a system might be implemented will serve as a foundation for further work.

Finally, we hope to lay out a series of recommended actions policy makers could take to move towards implementation of this connected system. Here our focus will shift to political, economic and human considerations. Our hope is for these to serve as areas of further research.

**Sources of data**

We see two broad categories of data analysis required within this dissertation.

First, several sources of data on licit and illicit trade exist (SIPRI, Small Arms Survey, UNODA, Equasis, iTrace etc). These will enable analysis of existing trade and control regimes. (probably beyond the scope of this dissertation)

Second, we expect our efforts to create a functional prototype of such a system to generate substantial amounts of data, which will be analyzed to assess its efficacy. The connected sensors will be recording data about their environment, which could be used as inputs to machine learning algorithms or passed into smart contract function calls. Further, the human custodians of these networked cases will generate some data in the form of cryptographically signed transactions to administrate the system.

While not currently our plan, we do feel this project is conducive to building an agent-based model, which might enable us to explore the complexity that might emerge at larger scales.

**Action plan for March**

My goals for March include:

Continue meeting with researchers, policy makers and business people, aiming to gain a general understanding of issue spaces including trade / logistics (including financing and insurance), non-proliferation / disarmament, diplomacy / treaties, and smart / Ricardian contracts. I hope to speak with people working at:

- Provenance
- Mattereum
- Antares / Lloyd's
- Trade financing banks (HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, etc)
- Port operators / customs officials
- United Nations (Container Control Programme, Office on Drugs and Crime, International Maritime Organization, Office for Disarmament Affairs, 1540 Committee, etc)
- UK Parliament
- FRONTEX
- Conflict Armament Research

*Maybe* develop topo.sol, a Solidity library for calculating topological relationships between spatial features on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (at ETHParis hackathon).

Begin to design physical and informational architectures required to develop a functional prototype; perhaps begin purchasing equipment and studying libraries.

Refine proposal topic with dissertation advisor, UCL staff and experts.

Complete Term 2 / 2.

Have a bit of fun in London.
