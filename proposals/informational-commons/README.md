# Working DISSERTATION PROPOSAL

"Self-sovereign sensors"

An agent-based model to explore behavior of networks of connected sensors participating in a data economy.

Modeling malicious, dishonest or inaccurate input devices.

  What is the effect of dishonesty on aggregate accuracy of information collected from networks of sensors?

## Model Design

Agents: sensors, gateways (near-edge computing points without resource constraints - necessary?), DAOs as data brokers.

A DAO as a data clearinghouse or broker.
- Machines are participants in the DAO, able to invoke contract functions via machine-controlled externally owned account (trusted hardware)
- Can submit key statistics of sensed attributes, and provide access to higher-resolution data upon request. i.e. Distilled information containing much of what is contained in the original dataset.
- Measuring the effect of how proportions of dishonest reporting affects data accuracy.
- Can we explore how variation in data collective governance models affects this? Which model is most robust against dishonesty?
  - Siloed, not interoperable. No uniform data standard.
- Why a DAO? Why blockchains? As reference points for uncoordinated firms / data providers - informational utilities. What other entity could coordinate all this data?

First half: feasibility study

Second half: modeling the system
